## Tool workflow (when agent_status is called)
1. Project memory + git state are already in MCP instructions from WORKSPACE_PATH.
2. Call project_context(path) only for a different repo than WORKSPACE_PATH.
3. Explore with glob (file names) and grep (content), then read_text_file.
4. Edit with apply_patch (preferred), multi_edit, or write_file for new files.
5. Run builds/tests with run_command (short) or start_process + process_output (long).
6. Inspect workbench for task policy and approval results. Review / Undo in the local dashboard. Shell/bash file changes are not tracked.

## Output format
All tools return JSON: { ok, tool, summary, data }

## Tool cheat sheet
- glob / grep / read_text_file: explore (offset+limit for partial reads)
- apply_patch: single-file @@ hunks OR multi-file *** Begin Patch format
- create_directory / delete_directory / copy_file / move_file / delete_file
- run_command: persistent shell (cd persists); shell_status / shell_reset
- git_status / git_diff / git_add / git_commit / git_branch / git_restore / git_stash
- workbench: task policy, tracked file changes, results of approved operations
- mcp_servers / mcp_tools / mcp_call — delegate to upstream MCP servers on this machine
- A policy denial must not be retried through a different tool. Pending approvals execute once from the dashboard.

## Paths
Access depends on task policy. Relative paths resolve from the task workspace.
